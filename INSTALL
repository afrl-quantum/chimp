Installation Instructions
*************************

This project uses both the Boost.Build and CMake system which separately
automatically track link, include, and other dependencies among any number of
libraries and projects.  You may use either the Boost.Build or CMake build
systems independently.  Below, you should find instructions for using either
Boost.Build, CMake, or a general system-style installtion.

Boost.Build:
  If you use Boost.Build, integrating this library into your own project is
  the MOST EASY.  No installation beyond storing CHIMP somewhere on your
  harddrive.  To use chimp in your Boost.Build project, you simply include a
  line like:

      use-project /chimp : path/to/chimp ;

  where the path/to/chimp path can be either relative or absolute.  
  This library has several sub-libraries that are useful and which will
  invoke the proper linking to external libraries as needed.

      /chimp//headers    : only provides <include> dependencies
      /chimp//particledb : invokes linking to the Particle database library
                           useful for particle simulations such as DSMC.
                           Also links in required libs (e.g Boost.Regex)
      /chimp//em         : (conceptual still) invokes linking to the
                           electro-magnetic constants and properties database
                           library.
      /chimp//mechanical : (conceptual still) invokes linking to the mechanical
                           constants and properties database library.

  External libraries required by various components:
    Boost.Regex
    xylose
    physical

        Each of Boost, xylose, physical libraries includes a Boost.Build
        setup.  Just store these packages in the same directory as the chimp
        package. 

    libxml2
        Should be installed somewhere on your system and the xml2-config command
        from that installation should be in your path.


CMake:
  CMake files also accompany the package and make it easier to use in a
  CMake environment.  To use in a CMake environment, just add appropriate
  lines to your master CMakeLists.txt file, such as

      add_subdirectory(chimp)

  You will also have to include the proper line for the include paths, such
  as:
      include_directories(
        ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/path/to/your/code
        ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/chimp/src
      )


General Install:
  These instructions are for installing this software into a standard layout
  where libraries are installed to  <prefix>/lib
  and headers are installed to      <prefix>/include
  and xml data are installed to     <prefix>/include/../share/chimp/data
  DEFAULT:  <prefix> = /usr/local

  For a simple install, just do:
  
      bjam install
  
  To change the installation path, use
  
      bjam --prefix=/path/to/install/into/ install
  
  For help on other options, execute
  
      bjam --help


  External library installations required:
    Boost.Regex
    xylose
    physical
    libxml2
