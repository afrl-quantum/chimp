Installation Instructions
*************************

This project uses the Boost.Build system which automatically tracks link,
include, and other dependencies among any number of libraries and projects.
These instructions assume that you have Boost.Build installed on your system.

Boost.Build:
  If you use Boost.Build, integrating this library into your own project is
  the MOST EASY.  No installation beyond storing CHIMP somewhere on your
  harddrive.  To use chimp in your Boost.Build project, you simply include a
  line like:

      use-project /chimp : path/to/chimp ;

  where the path/to/chimp path can be either relative or absolute.  
  This library has several sub-libraries that are useful and which will
  invoke the proper linking to external libraries as needed.

      /chimp//headers    : only provides <include> dependencies
      /chimp//particledb : invokes linking to the Particle database library
                           useful for particle simulations such as DSMC.
                           Also links in required libs (e.g Boost.Regex)
      /chimp//em         : (conceptual still) invokes linking to the
                           electro-magnetic constants and properties database
                           library.
      /chimp//mechanical : (conceptual still) invokes linking to the mechanical
                           constants and properties database library.

  External libraries required by various components:
    Boost.Regex
    olson-tools
        In the future, the components of this all-purpose library will be
        imported into a more specialized compact library.
    physical

        Each of Boost, olson-tools, physical libraries includes a Boost.Build
        setup.  Just store these packages in the same directory as the chimp
        package. 

    libxml2
        Should be installed somewhere on your system and the xml2-config command
        from that installation should be in your path.

General Install:
  These instructions are for installing this software into a standard layout
  where libraries are installed to  <prefix>/lib
  and headers are installed to      <prefix>/include
  and xml data are installed to     <prefix>/include/../share/chimp/data
  DEFAULT:  <prefix> = /usr/local

  For a simple install, just do:
  
      bjam install
  
  To change the installation path, use
  
      bjam --prefix=/path/to/install/into/ install
  
  For help on other options, execute
  
      bjam --help


  External library installations required:
    Boost.Regex
    olson-tools
        In the future, the components of this all-purpose library will be
        imported into a more specialized compact library.
