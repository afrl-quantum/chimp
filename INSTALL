Installation Instructions
*************************

This project uses the Boost.Build system which automatically tracks
link, include, and other dependencies among any number of libraries and
projects.  Except for using the (unfinished) CMake build configuration, these
instructions assume that you have Boost.Build installed on your system.  

General Install:
  These instructions are for installing this software into a standard layout
  where libraries are installed to  <prefix>/lib
  and headers are installed to      <prefix>/include
  and xml data are installed to     <prefix>/include/../share/chimp/data
  DEFAULT:  <prefix> = /usr/local

  For a simple install, just do:
  
      bjam install
  
  To change the installation path, use
  
      bjam --prefix=/path/to/install/into/ install
  
  For help on other options, execute
  
      bjam --help


Boost.Build:
  If you use Boost.Build, integrating this library into your own project is
  the most easy.  You simply, include a line like:

      use-project /chimp : path/to/chimp ;

  where the path/to/chimp path can be either relative or absolute.  
  This library has several sub-libraries that are useful and which will
  invoke the proper linking to other libraries such as Boost.Regex.

      /chimp//headers    : only provides <include> dependencies
      /chimp//particledb : invokes linking to the Particle database library
                           useful for particle simulations such as DSMC.
                           Also links in required libs (e.g Boost.Regex)
      /chimp//em         : (conceptual still) invokes linking to the
                           electro-magnetic constants and properties database
                           library.
      /chimp//mechanical : (conceptual still) invokes linking to the mechanical
                           constants and properties database library.

CMake:
  CMake files also accompany the package and make it easier to use in a
  CMake environment.  To use in a CMake environment, just add appropriate
  lines to your master CMakeLists.txt file, such as

      add_subdirectory(chimp)

  You will also have to include the proper line for the include paths, such
  as:
      include_directories(
        ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/path/to/your/code
        ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/chimp/src
      )

  NOTE:  the CMake files are a work in progress and may not work yet.
