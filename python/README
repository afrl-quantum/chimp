The purpose of this CHIMP::Python package is (currently) to ease the burden of importing
and formatting new data into the formats used and defined by CHIMP.  

Non-standard Python dependencies:
  numpy
    Numpy includes many numerical matrix and vector operations and related
    tools.  This package is used to handle the data tables of the
    chimp::interaction::cross_section::DATA class.
  lxml
    This is an excellent pythonesque interface to the libxml2 package.  The
    interface it provides greatly simplifies working with libxml2 and allows
    more rapid development.
  physical::python
    This is the Python component of the physical package.  This is the same
    physical package that the C++ CHIMP code depends upon.
